# surfRate-V2
New version surfRate with connection to surfRate API (based on local host)

Simple application to keep track of surf activity/conditions. 
It works together now with the surfRate API. 

You can click on a location on the map to create a new surfspot (required to login for this, you can create an account but it needs the apikey to stormglass api).
The surfspot will be automaticly updated on the menu on the left. 
When clicked on a surfspot you will be able to make new surfSessions (requires login), this will get the current weather/condition data out of the stormglass api.
This combined data with the experiences filled in by the user will be displayed in the sessions menu from the spot.
